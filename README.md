## Developer Setup

Currently, Marinara is configured for developers working and packaging releases on Mac OS. Support for Linux or Windows is welcome.

Marinara uses the system `ruby` and `make` tools to build releases.

It also uses [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) to manipulate the `manifest.json`. You can quickly install it using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

    brew install jq

For Linux run:

    sudo apt-get install jq
    sudo apt-get install ruby-full

Once installed you can package a release by running:

    make package

This will produce a packaged extension ready for uploading to the Chrome Web Store in the root directory of the project.
